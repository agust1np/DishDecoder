## Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v14 or newer.
- **AWS S3**: Bucket with appropriate CORS and IAM configurations.
- **Together AI**: API key for LLaMA Vision and Parsing models.
- **Google Cloud**: API key and search engine ID for Google Custom Search.
- **Upstash**: Redis endpoint and token for caching.

### AWS S3 Setup

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**  
   - Log in to the AWS S3 console.  
   - Create a new bucket with a unique name and a suitable region.  
   - Disable public access blocking if you intend to allow uploads and external access.

2. **Configure CORS**  
   - Go to your new bucketâ€™s settings.  
   - Under **Permissions** > **CORS**, add the following configuration:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
         "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
         "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
       }
     ]
     ```

3. **Create an IAM User**  
   - In the AWS IAM console, create a new user with programmatic access.  
   - Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy to allow full S3 operations.  
   - Save the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for later use.

### Required APIs

1. **Together AI**  
   - Sign up at [Together AI](https://together.xyz/) and obtain your API key.

2. **Google Custom Search**  
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
   - Create a new project, enable the **Custom Search API**, and generate API credentials.  
   - Set up a **Programmable Search Engine** via [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) to restrict your searches if needed.

3. **Upstash Redis**  
   - Sign up at [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) and retrieve your **Redis URL** and **Token**.
